# Introduction

This is an example analysis for the 'Robust and Open Analysis in R' workshop. 

We shall be exploring the 'Old Faithful' dataset from Base R. 


# Import and save data

First we import the data from the datasets package. 
```{r}
df <- datasets::faithful
```

We can now save this in the `data` folder as a `csv` for maximum interoptability. 

```{r}
readr::write_csv(x=df, path='data/old_faithfull.csv')

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
